# Hate-speech-detector-using-machine-learning
# Conclusion:
In this work, we present the target classification of hate speech for social using machine learning. We are using two algorithms as a classifier to compare the results.
Those algorithms are SVM and Na¨ıve Bayes Two-term weighting schemes including
Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF are used and several word n-grams are used as feature
representations. From previous work and literature survey we found that using Bagof-Words as term weighting scheme, the best result achieved F1-score more than 0.85
using SVM with word unigram as the feature. When using TF-IDF as term weighting
scheme, the best result achieved F1-score more than 0.82 also using SVM and word
unigram as the feature. The results show that word unigram is good feature representation for hate speech target classification in Twitter. In terms of term weighting
scheme, TF-IDF achieved a slightly better result than Bag-of-Words with a difference
in F1-score of 0.00249. According to the results obtained from previous work, we can
conclude that SVM is the best algorithm for hate speech target classification. hence
we are using SVM and Naive bays algorithm for this work.
